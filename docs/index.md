Cloud technologies allow research institutes and commercial
enterprises to optimize their computing environment for their
applications, while minimizing operational effort and costs. Many
institutes and enterprises now require engineers to have both
theoretical and practical mastery of these technologies.

This course starts with an overview of current cloud technologies,
provides details for Infrastructure as a Service clouds, compares
hypervisor- and container-based infrastructures, shows how clouds can
be combined to create hybrid infrastructures, and then demonstrates
how these technologies extend to the "edge" of the network.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to be comfortable working from the command line
within Linux operating systems (CentOS and Ubuntu) and capable of
performing simple administrative tasks, such as the installation of
packages and management of system services.

The practical exercises intensively use the REST and Python APIs of
the cloud infrastructures and other services.  Consequently, students
must have a solid grounding in the Python programming language and
good knowledge of the HTTP(S) protocol. Experience with other
programming languages such as Java would be beneficial.

## Course Organization

The course is organized with lectures in the morning (~3 hours) and
practical exercises in the afternoon (~4 hours).  Each day covers a
different topic:

 1. Overview of Cloud Technologies

 1. IaaS Programming Interfaces

 1. Hybrid Cloud Infrastructures

 1. Containerized Applications

 1. Edge Computing
