# Machine Learning Example

 * Attach webcam to your RPi
 * Launch the OpenCV example application
 * Verify that you can see the web interface
 * Verify that the application identifies faces in the video stream

 * Examine the example, identifying the parts of the application that
   provide the web interface, capture the video stream, and perform
   the video analysis.

 * Think about how machine learning would fit into platform? What
   parts of an application would run on the edge device (RPi) and what
   parts would run elsewhere?  What data is analyzed on the edge
   device and what data is analyzed elsewhere?
