# Prerequisites

The technical exercises rely heavily on the use of standard software
development and testing tools. These often require interaction with
remote systems via the command line.

You are expected to have a working knowledge of:

 * Linux system management tasks such as installing, configuring, and
   running standard services, especially on Ubuntu.

 * Use of SSH to access remote machines. 
 
 * Source code management with `git`, specifically as implemented by
   GitHub.

 * Docker: building and running containerized applications.

You should also be familiar with basic ideas behind continuous
integration/delivery and the types of services used to implement
them. 

Some information concerning these topics can be found in the
prerequisites section of the Hybrid Cloud training. You can also find
plenty of good information on the web.
