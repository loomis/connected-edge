# Nuvla

 * Create an account on Nuvla (if you don't have one already)

 * Create a NuvlaBox device from the Nuvla portal.

 * Copy the NuvlaBox OS to an SD card.

 * Customize the configuration file with your device ID and public SSH
   key.

 * Boot the device from the modified SD card and ensure that the
   device shows up in the Nuvla dashboad.

 * Create an application in Nuvla tied to your customized container.

 * Launch that application on your device and ensure that the
   application is visible.

 * Try launching the OpenCV example to see if peripherials on the
   device can be used. 

 * Understand the deployment and management model of Nuvla. What does
   Nuvla add compared to jus a collection of RPi machines? What is the
   primary entity (program, device, etc.)? How are the entities in the
   platform related?
