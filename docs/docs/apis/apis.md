# IaaS Programming Interfaces

The REST and Python programming interfaces of AWS, OpenStack, and
CloudStack will be presented and compared. Apache Libcloud will also
be presented to demonstrate how an abstract API can be used to provide
application portability between cloud infrastructures. Students will
use the REST and Python APIs of the services to provision cloud
resources and to learn how to automate the deployment of common
applications.
