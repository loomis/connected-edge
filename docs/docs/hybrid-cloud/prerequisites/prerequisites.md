# Prerequisites

By design, cloud and edge computing scenarios involve the use of
remote computing resources that are accessible only via the Internet.
For cloud computing, these resources reside in data centers operated
by cloud service providers. Edge computing devices live at the "edge"
of the network close to sensors that collect interesting data, e.g.
bus stops and electrical distribution cabinets.

The vast majority of cloud and edge resources run versions of the
Linux operating system. This course makes extensive use of the Linux
operating system and consequently, students should:

 - Have a local machine (laptop or workstation) that provides a
   Linux-like environment for interacting with cloud and edge
   resources,

 - Know how to use the Linux operating system via the command line,
   and

 - Be familiar with protocols and tools for remote access to machines,
   notably SSH.

 - Have some programming experience in Python (or another programming
   language) and understand how the HTTP protocol works.

The following sections provide some details for each of these
prerequisites.
