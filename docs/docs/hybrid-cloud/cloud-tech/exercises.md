# Exercises

These exercises will help you understand the core features of an
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud infrastructure. Although
nearly all IaaS cloud infrastructures have the same core features,
details differ between them.

expanded to Germany and Austria. It focuses on the European market and
prides itself on providing robust services at a competitive price.
