Cloud technologies allow research institutes and commercial
enterprises to optimize their computing environment for their
applications, while minimizing operational effort and costs. Many
institutes and enterprises now require engineers to have both
theoretical and practical mastery of these technologies.

This course starts with an overview of current cloud technologies,
provides details for Infrastructure as a Service clouds, compares
hypervisor- and container-based infrastructures, shows how
interactions with clouds can be automated, and then demonstrates how
these technologies extend to the "edge" of the network.

Before starting the training itself, **please review the
prerequisites** and read the linked material if necessary.
