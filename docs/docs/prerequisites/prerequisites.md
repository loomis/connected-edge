# Prerequisites

Students are expected to be comfortable working from the command line
within Linux operating systems (CentOS and Ubuntu) and capable of
performing simple administrative tasks, such as the installation of
packages and management of system services.

The practical exercises intensively use the REST and Python APIs of
the cloud infrastructures and other services.  Consequently, students
must have a solid grounding in the Python programming language and
good knowledge of the HTTP(S) protocol. Experience with other
programming languages such as Java would be beneficial.
