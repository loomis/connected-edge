# Python Programming

Automating interactions with cloud services and edge devices often
requires use of their Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs). Although a variety of different languages can be used, this
training uses the Python programming language in the programming
examples.

The programming examples in this training are simple and anyone with a
reasonable understanding of programming in any language should be able
to follow and to execute them. Nonetheless, it would be worthwhile to
review the basics of Python. You might want to follow the official
[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) or
the one from
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp).
