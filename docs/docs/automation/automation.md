# Automation

A customized cloud infrastructure consisting of several different
platforms quickly becomes a necessity for many institutes, either
because of geographic constraints, placing computation near data
sources for efficiency, or access to specialized resources. Techniques
for hiding the complexity and heterogeneity of these platforms will be
presented.  Students will continue to use Libcloud as one solution,
but also explore cloud-agnostic systems like Terraform.  The
advantages and disadvantages of each will be highlighted in the
exercises.

# Exercises

Look at Module I, Module II, and Module III of the [SlipStream
Tutorial](http://ssdocs.sixsq.com/en/latest/tutorials/ss/index.html)

Use the infomation there to:

 1. Create an account on [nuv.la](https://nuv.la).
 1. Edit your user profile:
    - add your first and last names
    - add your SSH public key
    - set your default cloud to one of the exoscale regions
    - add your Exoscale API/Key secret to the cloud configuration
