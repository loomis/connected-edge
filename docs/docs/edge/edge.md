# Edge Computing

An ever-increasing amount of data is being generated at the "edge" of
the network by sensors and other sources. The volume, and sometimes
privacy concerns, often make the transport of these data to a central
location for analysis problematic.  Students will learn how hybrid
cloud techniques can be used to facilitate "edge" computing. The
exercises will make use of Nuvla and NuvlaBox edge devices to show how
cloud technologies can make edge computing a practical reality.
