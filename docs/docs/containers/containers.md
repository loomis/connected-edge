# Containerized Applications

Docker has popularized the use of Linux containers to package and to
share applications. The basics of the Docker ecosystem will be
presented including Docker Compose (for multi-service applications)
and Docker Swarm for an extensible container-based
infrastructure. Students will learn how to containerize applications
and manage their lifecycle, including sharing those applications with
others. The advantages and disadvantages of containers will be
compared to virtual machines.  Kubernetes, currently the most popular
container orchestration engine, provides functionalities that are
similar to the Docker engine, docker-compose, and Docker Swarm. Its
model and API differ from Docker. Students will learn to use K8S to
deploy and manage containerized applications. Its features will be
compared to those of Docker.
