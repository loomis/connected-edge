# Containerized Applications

Docker has popularized the use of Linux containers to package and to
share applications.

The basics of the Docker ecosystem will be presented including Docker
Compose (for multi-service applications) and Docker Swarm for an
extensible container-based infrastructure.

Students will learn how to containerize applications and manage their
lifecycle, including sharing those applications with others.

The advantages and disadvantages of containers will be compared to
virtual machines.  Kubernetes, currently the most popular container
orchestration engine, provides functionalities that are similar to the
Docker engine, docker-compose, and Docker Swarm. Its model and API
differ from Docker. Its features will be compared to those of Docker.
