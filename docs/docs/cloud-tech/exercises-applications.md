# Applications

After the previous exercises, you understand how to create virtual
machines and store data as objects on the cloud. Although being able
to allocate resource dynamically is a clear benefit, a VM with a
minimal operating system by itself isn't very useful. To really
benefit, the VMs need to be transformed into useful transient or
permanent services.

As examples, you will create a web server with nginx, a standalone
Docker machine, and a standalone Anaconda server.  Afterwards, the
last two will be transformed into multi-VM clusters.
