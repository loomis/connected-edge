# Cloud Technologies

A survey of the types of cloud technologies that are available, how
they compare to one another, and how they can be used for data
analysis. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds will be emphasized
as they provide the maximum flexibility and are most common.  Students
will familiarize themselves with Exoscale, a public cloud originally
based in Switzerland, by using its web browser interface to provision
cloud resources.
