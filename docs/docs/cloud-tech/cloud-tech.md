# Cloud Technologies

A survey of the types of cloud technologies that are available, how
they compare to one another, and how they can be used for data
analysis. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds will be emphasized
as they provide the maximum flexibility and are most common.  Students
will familiarize themselves with AWS and Exoscale (two commercial
clouds) by using their web browser interfaces to provision cloud
resources.
